## What is it?

`mpv_crop_script.lua` is a script for making cropped screenshots from within [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv), without any external dependencies, cross-platform!

## How?

mpv by itself doesn't support cropped screenshots, but can be told to save a full screenshot at a specified location.
This full-sized image can then be cropped down to size, but this requires a tool to edit the image (like ImageMagick). Bothersome!

However, we can forget external dependencies by calling on mpv itself to use the built-in [encoding features](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#encoding). Bam!

## How do I install it?

Download the `mpv_crop_script.lua` file from this repository and place it in your mpv's `scripts` directory:

  * Linux/Unix/Mac: `~/.config/mpv/scripts/mpv_crop_script.lua`
  * Windows: `%APPDATA%\Roaming\mpv\scripts\mpv_crop_script.lua`

See the [Files section](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#files) in mpv's manual for more info.

## How do I use it?

Press `c` and crop away! You can toggle a crosshair and guides for the crop box with `c` and `x` while cropping.

Pressing `Enter` will save a cropped screenshot, while `ESC` will cancel the current crop.

## ï„¦ Fork specific development 

Recent changes have been made to the script to address the deprecation of MPV's 'tick' event system. The main modifications include:

1. Removed the deprecated 'tick' event listener that was causing warnings
2. Implemented a new render timer system using `mp.add_periodic_timer`
3. Updated the ASSCropper class to use the new timer mechanism
4. Modified timing-related functions to maintain the same 60fps refresh rate while being more efficient
5. Reorganized the timer initialization and management code

These changes ensure the script works with newer versions of MPV without any deprecation warnings while maintaining all original functionality. The render timer now updates at 60fps when active, following MPV's current best practices.

The script continues to provide the same features and performance, but with a more modern and efficient implementation of the rendering system. If you're upgrading from an older version, no configuration changes are needed - the updates are all internal improvements.
